### This project utilizes several datasets regarding the past Olympic events in order to create graphs showing the steady rise of attending athletes, the percentage of medals won by countries, the cost of hosting a Summer vs. a Winter Olympic event, and the Profits and Losses from hosting an event.

##### The Pandas library was used to parse through the datasets and find applicable information, while the Matplotlib library was used to generate the various graphs included in the project. 

##### We created our Dataset that includes:
    - Olympiad: The glorious years of Olympic history.
    - Host: The brave cities that took on the challenge.
    - Final Operating Budget: The initial "we-can-do-this" budget (in billions).
    - Total Costs: The final "oops-we-underestimated" bill (in billions).
    - Taxpayer Contribution: The hefty amount citizens had to cough up (in billions).
    - Profit/Loss: The final financial outcome â€“ profits (yay!) or losses (ouch).
    - Year Debt Paid Off: The year when the host city finally climbed out of debt.
